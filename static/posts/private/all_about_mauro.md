This document is a fresh attempt to describe who I am and how I operate. The intent is that I'll better understand who I am and thus suffer less from the associated crises that sometimes arise from self doubt.

# On how I am with work

## I want to be seen as **a team player** by my boss and coworkers

Specifically that means...

- I am responsive
 - I'm online when I say I'll be online. Starting early if possible. I'm OK with overstaying being online if for example I'm in the middle of a discussion with my team or if I feel I haven't made enough progress that day.
- I am productive
 - What is "enough progress"? Either I've released a new feature, fixed an important bug, or have done enough other work including refactoring or writing tests.
 - I can improve by getting more specifc with what "enough progress" means, with myself, my team, and my partner.

## What is off-hours and what is on?

The hours is the time when I'm expected to be online. By online, it mostly means that I've got a green "available" icon next to my name on Slack, which right now means that I am connected on my computer. If I'm only connected on my phone, then it doesn't show the icon unless I'm actively looking at the app.

The hours can vary depending on my agreement with my team, but it should be an 8-hour block with at least 4 hours overlap with my team. At the **very least** 2 hours overlap. 

## If there is an emergency, I'm available to respond.

Why? Because if an app goes down so that users can't use it, that's cause for everyone, starting with the lead developer, to get online to get it back up. It's a common expectation I've seen in all my jobs since Disney, and it makes sense to me. Also, if I want freedom in when and how I work, I want to hold myself responsible to being available when the moment is most urgent.

Such a promise begs for boundaries. What is an emergency and what isn't? How much involvement is required for each type of scenario? How much is too much? I don't have an easy answer for this question, but I'll try to reason through it a bit.

Let's assume there are 3 types of responses:

1. Getting on the computer
2. Getting on the phone
3. No response at all

The first, getting on the computer, is to me the last response if I'm off-hours. If it's on-hours, and I'm not on my computer, I'm usually tense / nervous because I believe I should be online.
