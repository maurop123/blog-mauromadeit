# Intro

I'm a web developer working for a small startup-like team in a bigger well-established company. What's great about such an arrangement is that you don't have the same life-or-death pressure that keeps you working 24/7 like most startups have, and your boss is likely open-minded enough to consider such an arrangement.

After a while in any new venture, it can be difficult to remember how exactly one got through the trying ramp-up period. Since I'm still very much in the beginning of this, I'm hoping to glean some of the more useful early experiences for practical tip.

This is not only my first month of digital nomad life, but the first time I travel outside my home country (US). With that said, I'll try to filter out most of the obvious tidbits with help from more experienced travellers, but please excuse me if some slip through the cracks.

## What is a digital nomad?

If you haven't heard, a digital nomad is someone that travels while working remote. It's ideal for anyone who wants to travel and can land a gig that will pay them to work while doing so. Programmers, designers, and other professions that are almost entirely handled on a computer have an easier time making such a transition. The theory is that if you can figure out how to keep your employer happy while working remote, then this lifestyle can be sustained indefinitely.

### Why would your boss be against it?

Simply put, they don't know if they can trust you. That's why people are still required to drive to the office every day 9-5, or if your boss lets you skip rush hour traffic, that is ironically created by this very requirement, then it's 10-7.

It's easy to get mad at the system. It's not easy to suck it up and work on changing it with patience and a smile on your face, but that's likely what you're gonna have to do to get what you want in the end. Don't despair!

# It's hard to work while moving

There is no room for forgetting to charge your phone or your battery.

Buy an extra laptop battery and keep it charged to extend your time away from outlets. I didn't get my second battery in time for this trip, but already there are many times I've wished I had.

# Plan ahead and learn from what's passed

Some people plan ahead well, some have a good habit of reviewing the past, and some can remin ever-present in the moment, but few navigate all three well. Being in the moment is natural for me, so I don't know what to say to help with this, but it does seem that constantly facing new situations has a way of bringing one into the moment because of the need to pay attention to surroundings so to avoid trouble and catch opportunities.

As for keeping track of experiences, I've made a habit of keeping a log, sometimes written, but usually in a Google Doc. Whenever I have a chance, I go to the end of it, write the time, the day of the week if it's the first entry of the day, and also the date if it's been a few days since I last tracked it. This structure makes it easy for me to keep chronological track of my experiences without interrupting my stream of consciousness. The exercise itself of explicitly going through an experience helps to notice things about them that I may want to learn from, decide to handle differently, or simply remember fondly.

# The Good

To start with some obvious benefits to the whole deal

# The Bad

## You can't read your boss' face on Slack

Say goodbye to subtle social cues like body language or facial twitches that tell so much about what a person is likely thinking or feeling. If you think you've never noticed or relied on such inexplicits bits of info, you might start noticing them all of a sudden.

# The Practical

You may find a lot of articles or books telling you how to be a digital nomad, travel efficiently, or be effective in remote work, and while they're likely to help, none can tell you if you're doing it right. Mostly you gotta figure it out on your own. Since getting started is the hard part

## Discipline

As inpiring as the novelty is, it can also be very distracting.

The best description I've 

## Mastering Communication

### With your boss

Probably the most important thing is to figure out is what your boss *really* cares about. Why? Because when you don't know what he/she is thinking, it helps to keep in mind what the top thing on their list is anyway.

Your boss will also probably want to know when you're going to be online but mostly offline during their working hours. Make sure to overlap at least a couple hours with the rest of your team, but if you can swing it, 4 or more is great, especially to start.

### With your travelling partner(s)

Unless you're travelling with a bunch of other digital nomads, it's gonna take some explicit conversations every now and then with your partner on how to share the days while on the road. You might feel that hunting for hotspots with slow wifi in another country is 10x better than working from the office on that fiber connection, but your partner may not be as interested in the tour de coffee shops.

# Author notes

These notes are not meant to be published. Rather they are meant to help in writing this piece.

- Include a lot of pictures. Should be one of the best parts of writing this kind of post.
- Leave out some good questions. This isn't meant to be a comprehensive post, and it'd be good to leave some material for another if people are interested.
 - How to negotiate a remote work agreement.
